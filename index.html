				<h3>Varietal Wines</h3>
					<p>A Varietal describes a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label.  Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varietal">Read More</a> </p>

							<li><strong>Chardonnay</strong></li>
								<p>"Due to the "malleability" of Chardonnay in winemaking and its ability to reflect its terroir, there is not one distinct universal "style" or set of constants that could be applied to Chardonnay made across the globe." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardonnay">More</a> </p>
									<p>Featured Region: Burgundy <a href="http://www.totalwine.com/eng/guide-to-wine/chardonnay.cfm">More</a>:</p>

									</ul>
							
							<li><p><strong>Merlot</strong></p></ul>
								<p>"Merlot is a dark blue-coloured wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name Merlot is thought to be a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot">More</a> </p>
